Some preliminary work on Kaggle's "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" data set. 'notebook1.ipynb' performs some EDA (generally following suggestions from https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python ) and linear transformations on the quantized predictor columns, using these columns to perform a preliminary Linear Regression. From just the quantized predictors (i.e. ignoring string/categorial predictors for now), the LR trains to an R^2 of about 0.85.
